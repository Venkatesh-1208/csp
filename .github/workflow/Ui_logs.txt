Hi [Manager Name],

The infrastructure and CI/CD setup for the API and UI web apps have been completed successfully. The applications are deploying correctly and the hosting environment is stable.

The remaining issues (Swagger configuration and Azure AD authentication setup) are related to application-level configuration inside Program.cs and service registration. These require updates within the application codebase and should be handled by the development team.

From a DevOps perspective:

Azure App Services are configured correctly (.NET 8 runtime)

CI/CD pipelines are functioning

Deployment is successful

Health endpoint is responding

Kindly confirm if the development team can proceed with adjusting the application configuration for Swagger and authentication.

Thanks.
